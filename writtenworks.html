      Hello everyone, I’m Thom (miles) Deane and this is my book. The written
      works before you span from April 2019 to May 2023. The following texts,
      images, drawings, scans et al have been lifted from two sources, the notes
      app on my phone and a sketchbook I’ve kept throughout this time. These two
      streams of prose will begin to form memoirs when put upon the reader in a
      way such as this, when their content is poetic and intimate, but oh well,
      it was I who made this bed so now I who must lie in it. That blank Muji
      book way back then, we’re finally here now. What’s so bad about memoirs
      anyway, maybe someone could gain something from reading this after all?
      Lots of the passages have been written up recently, copied from their
      source exactly and compiled chronologically, most will function as
      singular entries which bear no relation to the next, only some are dated,
      at times we will dot around on the timeline of my life, and as an
      aesthetic choice we shall switch to italicised Times New Roman font for
      titles, untitled sections or when I could be bothered to provide
      retrospective comment… but you should be sure, none of this has ever
      before been seen. (Are you with me, my dear reader?) Before we get to it,
      there are some people left to commemorate and thank, these are: Chris
      Comerford Janet Deane & Euan May you all rest well <br />‘iPhone notes’<br />

      We come from this place that’s called like… (12th May 2020 at 11:12)<br />
      …the last gap because it’s got loads of holes and is really underground My
      auntie who is single irl has had a marriage proposal, the woman is really
      lovely Then I wAs in school again doing some English and I think this
      dream is recurring because I remember thinking god why haven’t we had
      maths in like two weeks Anyway we fast forward to the wedding where—we
      witness as the audience (because I was watching this like a film)—this
      really wide (imagine incomprehensibly, abstractly broad) Ellen DeGeneres
      shows up in a massive brown suit. She does not go in however, does not
      enter the church, likes she’s outside but can’t right Then we’re having
      the reception in like an underground office, really cement-y, no windows
      and me and my sibling were making pesto pasta with this guy who didn’t
      know how to connect his phone to a speaker – that was spliced in I
      remember because I had to explain it like three times and then he was
      talking about London’s air pollution and that’s why he hates it and then
      he moved three chairs away from me but left his phone and his phone rang
      later and it was a white blackberry with my little pony wallpaper OO OOO
      I’ve just remembered my English teacher from school was teaching obviously
      and I had written something with no paragraphs and they called me an idiot
      or something while marking it So later at the wedding this clapped guy in
      a blue hoodie was saying that him and his friends smoke weed by this green
      van that is always parked outside a house because the guy with the
      blackberry who was rude said that its house 157 a hush hush spy org or
      something that’s what I thought And then we were eating this thing that
      was bread with a ham crust and was really nice and then the tall guy from
      dick&dom showed up just as mega wide Ellen finally brought herself to come
      to this underground reception which was in a minimal office space btw with
      warm lighting just to set it out it turns out dick and dom guy used to be
      wide Ellen (WE)’s boyfriend and he was being like proper out of order
      causing a scene, he went behind the desk and was taking WE’s coat and
      stuff for her at the entrance and saying that ‘womthems have a lot of
      clothes’?? Then this Australian who I used to work with showed up and was
      shouting at him for this and Ellen was thankful – I don’t know if I’ve
      brought this up yet but WE was wearing a brown suit like beige brown
      mohair suit jacket and then maybe a peachy shirt type number under I don’t
      know – That’s kind of where it ended AHAHAHA WAIT NO, I went outside for a
      phone call or something and this is after my grandma, my aunties mother,
      was like unsure about whether this planned marriage that already had
      happened should take place? And then I missed the start of this
      choreographed (which took weeks of rehearsals) dance with everyone at the
      wedding right but I had a split second where I dreamt everyone practicing
      for this okay and then I was back in the room and I was coming into the
      room at 6 O’clock (south ways - not time) and everyone was looking at me
      rotating around the room in dance and I couldn’t find the space I was
      supposed to fit into and I remember just like crying about it in a frantic
      attempt to get out and get to my space, going against the current of
      people, I think my space had been filled by an extra <br />Snack tier list
      based on UK political parties<br />
      Include eras of parties like a labour Jezza or thatcher conservatives
      Sunbites as green Maccoys as a Jezza nato corp Pickled eggs and
      scratchlings as a Brexit party Lib Dems are veg tyrells Boris
      conservatives ‘ride the borris boat home types’ are standard tyrells as
      they only supply to Sainsburys and waitrose Kettle chips cheese and onion,
      not only cheese and onion but MATURE cheese and RED onion, this is for
      your average dad of two girls he sends to private school, the best private
      school in the country, (he isn’t too keen on Wycliffe)(only has crisps
      when with vino) this guy makes you scared to tell him which school in the
      stroud district you went to, this isn’t based off anyone by the way, all
      fictional of course, not based off a guy who drank large red wines at the
      Bear of Rodborough hotel’s bar circa 2018-20, he’s about 5,7”, drinks
      large wines, complains of the wife and the toxicity inside him fuels his
      thirst for these crisps, he soars and then slides down into the glass like
      his Debenhams stocks, he can take them. The next kettle chips are an
      amazing potato crisp, the usual texture of the kettle chip is
      there—beaut—and then the seasoning is exquisite I’m gonna have to put this
      in a central Blair labour party probably as I think that voter base would
      love them, I love them too but they are a bit pricey, if I was more
      wealthy, more inclined to think that the Alastair Campbell book was a good
      read or if I had faith in them I would probably buy the crisps more often.
      Tyrells, elitism in a bland crisp, ONLY supplied to waitrose and sainos do
      I need to say anything more - thatcher tories Sunbites are of course green
      party Doritos chilli heatwave ARE for the people but a factor that edges
      them to the position I’m thinking of is the fact that they are the only
      vegan crisp of the doritos cannon and so I will put this in lib dem as
      this is the crisp choice of your vegan tactical lib dem voter peer from
      Cheltenham. Pork scratching are obviously a UKIP / Brexit party sort – the
      kind of man who gets an ale at pub, watches it as the bartender pours it,
      he’s sighing, a big fuck off misogynist and a racist of course, hates the
      EU and the immigrants – also would be known to consume pickled eggs if
      they had them behind the bar. So monster munch, no matter how much I enjoy
      them I think they have been appropriated in recent times a bit because
      people who back in MM’s heyday that never would have touched the crisps,
      the sons and daughters of middle class Thatcherites in the 80’s they
      wouldn’t touch it, they were a working class crisp, but now after a
      resurgence I think that its those using my dear monster munch to slum it
      down here with the rest of us, they are your classic Friday night dinner
      (TV show) watchers and they love a bit of monster munch now. They rode the
      Borris boat home on election night. If you ate alien crisps back in the
      day (Space Raiders) you are clearly a sick and unique legend, hopefully
      you have not been alienated by the labour parties as of late, you’re
      clinging on in there, maybe you’re even a bit socialist now, you believe
      these crisps should be provided by the state in a glorious peace-filled
      utopian future. I don’t think I’d eat these now though because there are
      too many good memories and I’ve built them up in my head too much, to a
      point where they cannot live up to. I’ll put these in a labour for jezzas
      era, maybe even green party as this is a very time and place laden memory
      for myself and I was known to have voted for the green party in Stroud on
      one occasion. Incorporate leaders into crisp branding painting - idea from

      Firstly, big well done !! Sounds like it was a productive and healthy
      convo so that’s super sick – in terms of moving on and the future for the
      both of u I feel like its important that you focus on trying to move past
      this relationship in its present state. There’s no way to predict what
      will happen in the future so it only holds the both of u back from healing
      and keeps you guys tied to a relationship that ultimately hasn’t worked
      out (this doesn’t mean to say that a new one between you both won’t grow)
      but this one right now is certainly finished, right? So, by moving past
      this and trying to heal n let go it opens up space for u both to have a
      new healthy relationship in whatever form it takes in the future !!

      An important distinction to begin with… those I am going to speak about in
      the following passages are not those I would usually make works about.
      These are not the most flagrant offenders who’s personas, to me, are
      completely tied to their classist actions. No, these I speak of now are
      the ones who’s slights and cloaked biases render them corrupt-in-part.
      Something they share with those I would usually refer to is their need for
      atonement, this latter group’s sins can still be redeemed with effort,
      however. These are not commonly those individuals achieving the abstract
      concept of ‘class mobility’, these are people who often benefit from ‘a
      little’ money that has been in the family a long time. Xenophobic
      ‘foreigner’ comments from those who have never had to conversate with
      anyone from outside of the UK in an intimate setting, intimate setting
      comprising anything from a workplace to sexual relationship. It is within
      reason to define their inability to communicate with their ‘othered in
      nationality’ counterparts as an inability to communicate with the
      proletariat, an overwhelming proportion of this of course are non-English;
      are not middle class; speak dialect in accents when speaking English; may
      not be white; what does this inability to communicate with those white
      people they other say for their communication skills with non-whites?
      Those young people with this class status, most have not yet challenged
      the pre-conceived notions in their mind. They have somehow still not
      deemed it necessary. This situation is so dire in some individuals that
      when, now looking out and fully perceiving the world, the biases of their
      parents, of their environments, manage to permeate their minds, leak from
      the walls of their mouths through their lips, and even in the faces of
      stunned listeners, the biases still go unquestioned. Their parents
      thoughts now even pair well with their own learned unquenchable lust for
      ‘debate’. Some challenge their subconscious ways with backwards methods
      however, giving an outcome worse still than the last described batch of
      undesirables. Here I refer to: !posho’s and their usage of words such as
      ‘ends’ and other bits of poached language, language not for them, not made
      by them, words which are at complete odds with who they are! Anouk, horse
      rider and owner, saying: ‘feds in our ends’ – is this an attempt at
      camouflaging ones own class status? Larping as ones of the prolly, are we?
      Of which, you are not. (Next their co-opting of spaces, of genres +
      language) Ted maxi ski – idk why he relates leftism to the gay rights or
      feminist movements when espousing how bad leftism is for revolution
      Leftism as a form of faith however I think is an interesting way of
      looking at things, as those who don’t practice the doctrine are told they
      are sinners to be scorned with parables to be spoken at them (In a big,
      long list of offences)…they don’t let the plights of the houseless be just
      that, they have to confide in you (after you’ve been approached and the
      hard sleeper has left) what ‘that one’ is known as in this area, what the
      people call them and how it relates to their usually evoked lines. …if
      you’ve found an example of an act you have been guilty of in the past, or
      if you’ve found an exact act you know you’ve committed which I have
      witnessed, I hope you can learn from my reflective interpretation of such
      events, and as ever I am always open to discuss aspect x, y or z of my
      works, this time to the letter. <br />NÜ English Manifesto<br />

      a nice, very square, cute, little house so it’s just a slab of something
      above your head and two poles. At the base of this porch, below the door,
      there’s like a big entry step slab into the house cus the house is also
      built into the ground a bit. U go out there and it s like ahh smoking on a

      labour situation starts and the postcode is integral to the tattoos in the
      camp then I know I’m killing the guy with the GL5 tat. Otherwise, they’ll

      In a place where I know I’ve had it bad, but not too bad when comparing,
      With the half moon lighting up the night sky, With no noise bar the echoes
      of the A48’s movements which rumble by, Under the stars which are
      centuries, millennia, adjectives old, And in this empty park, On a bench
      at the centre of the green space forced between the younger kids park and
      the older kids park, With only some of the facility next door’s yellow
      lights accompanying me, And the dark blocky houses behind me, I feel so
      small, I worked until I was completely exhausted, The next year I came
      back to a new place and I work myself to exhaustion again, I don’t stop
      until my hands bloat (/swell?), have heat rashes, cut, blister, bruise,
      break, My nails snap, get dirty, get long, get filed back ‘until nothing
      is left’, grown again, grow misshapen, grown ingrown, Muscles tone,
      thoughts are though, left half-thought and finished later or are
      forgotten, Things are listened to, People are listened to, spoken to,
      Wrong things are said, Tensions are high, Tensions fade, Aeroplanes fly
      overhead, Bedsheet-Kites fly on strings, Things are acknowledged, People
      are uninterested to other things, They say, “you alright?”, I say, “not
      too bad thanks, how are you?”, Elsewhere I might say, “what you saying?”;
      they say my answer back of, “not a lot”, is given every time, Here I see
      holes in the ceiling, There I see pristine, tall houses, Here they fall
      shorter, Ships which pass in the night always miss each other, Sleeping up
      and awake down, Living rooms are shared, Successfully and unsuccessfully
      and successfully again, Boundaries are respected or not and are respected
      again, Again retreating, Again okay, Again, warming up for return, Also
      making mistakes, Also learning, Ever growing, Ever proud, I must sort
      these nails out, Where’s the antiseptic and the cotton pads? Roll them up
      small and tight and place beneath the nailbed, Trimming, Honing, Learning
      new languages, Reading challenging books, Falling deeper into exclusions,
      I should start writing, I haven’t read enough (anything) to write yet,
      Spending nights staring at screens, Reclaiming time, Causing more fatigue,
      Draining, Draining, Wash cycle, Talks of occupation, I deserve a raise,
      Making noises while sitting down, Anti slip shoes, Abstract depictions of
      odd revolutions, Giving myself pins and needles when in the bathroom,
      Little windows inside houses, Betnovate steroid cream, Irritations,
      Clarityn hay fever relief, Cycles, Driving, People dying, Cats in
      mourning, Parks at night-time, Parklife next morning, This bench now, that
      tomorrow, Dogs met, Their walkers met, They were boring, Old friends met,
      Always late, Socialising, Water droplets accounted for, Can’t leave a
      mess, Car’s a mess, Vocal training, Golden Cross junction, 11:57, For me
      I’m early, Ample space in disabled loos, Why’d I have to step on the cat?
      I didn’t bring that water bottle in here, did I? Always forgetful, Minds a
      sieve, So bloody boring, Stop it stop it, Stop replaying it, Posho’s
      saying ‘chav’, Stop picturing it, I need the park, Taking in scenery,
      Trains rattle by, Big, small, old, new, oil freighter, new pedestrian
      crossing, That was a pain to walk around, wasn’t it? It’s too late now,
      The time’s gone three, My legs aren’t even tired anymore, All again
      tomorrow, 2 days left, 5 days on, 2 days off, For not enough money, For
      far too much exhaustion, This is an example of a good hospitality
      workplace, Old place wants me back, Should have treated me like a person
      then shouldn’t you? Always misgendered, Always ‘bro’ when it’s beef, I’m
      always listening, Why make myself the mug by rising to call someone a
      classist who I already knew to be a classist? In the park you can sit on a
      bench and see the moon and the stars and have some warm lights for company
      at the least and the leaves will all rustle and lungs will fill to the
      bottom with good clean air. And eventually I’ll sleep and it might be the
      same tomorrow as it was today but I might just be okay too, some really
      lovely people will be there I’m sure, wherever I am I can always come back
      home or go back to that park, I can always not start the car or I can stop
      driving half way if I feel unsafe and I can always push my mirrors down so
      that I can see the curb and swiftly reverse into the space at the end of
      the road that goes nowhere by the bollards and the swooping designed and
      maintained council grass which leads up to the park. And I can get out
      there and go straight in and lie down and feel the grass, whip off shoes
      and socks if needs be and just stare, at something, because there’s always
      something. There really is a lot going for this little place.

      Script<br />
      When I started making this film, I believe I was quite lost. It sounds
      like a metal yard, or like a group of people clanging their pickaxes into
      stone in unison. Like they’re doing it at me all together, echoing to me
      from across the stretch like mantle-rippling cracks pointing to one
      epicentre, me, I’m trapped in the middle of this wind-chime hung up on a
      string imprisoned by metal rods and with noise as though I’m entering a
      shop all around me. But It’s a calming song to me as my mum has always
      kept a wind charm above the front door in our house. Almost two years ago
      on my 21st birthday, I spoke to my friends from Stonehouse for the last
      time. Since going to uni and realising we were inevitably fading apart, I
      had wondered when a friendship ending event would take place, or if it
      would be them who would leave me behind first. One day it happened, and I
      haven’t seen or heard of them since. It’s like they just completely
      vanished one day off the face of the earth. My films which focus on my
      existence are, like this one, often set in Stonehouse. The hours of raw
      footage I’ve captured here should work to prove that I’ve been out here,
      I’ve been around, outside often, often in the most popular places of the
      town or places near their houses; to have not seen them once by chance in
      this small place is frankly bizarre. I feel like this place breeds this
      kind of occurrence though, as with someone who lives on my road, I’ve had
      the same ghostly thing going on for years. This individual and I (I have
      caught a few glimpses of the man’s face over the years, but only ever
      glimpses!) have been parking our cars by each other everyday, swapping
      places sometimes up to twice a day, all happening in the dead zone by the
      bollards. I think it speaks to a certain level of understanding that we
      have for each other when sometimes he parks front-in at the space to the
      right because he knows I like to swing my car around and reverse in closer
      to the path. Common understanding by on-street Parkers who don’t know each
      other’s names but know the way they like to park, ghostly. As I progressed
      through very early filming stages of this work, after being made to show
      my footage to peers, I was told more refinement was needed. More intention
      to be placed into each frame. I refuted the idea at first but then started
      diligently doing so, or at least I began to think about doing so. I
      started to read everything I had ever written, I began to look again (this
      time truly) at all whom I’d known for two decades, I began looking inside
      my camera roll for times, eras, faces, places. What you find on screen
      behind this note, is an intentionally lengthy blue screen with a rolling
      cassette animation, neither of these decals were created by me. There may
      be glitches found in this film, in the remaining cassette footage I have
      left to show, but none of these effects were intentionally produced
      either, they may have at most been found and then left in, they now work
      to break up the piece, and just as the length of this introduction, and
      the breadth of this blue and white screen has been dictated, viewable and
      auditorily described the rest of the footage shall be too, and it will be
      done in a way that I’ve seen fit, in a way I regard for people, not about
      them. Fans of narrative should enjoy this work, before you viewer
      (reader), lies a series of vignettes, a collection of brief moments
      captured from the muddy void. When I started making this film, I believed
      I was quite lost, but actually I think I was too found. Too in place I get
      suburban paranoia creeping in, I stop thinking, seize up with dread and go
      into disrepair. After breaking free I can grip onto a thought again and
      explore it absolutely. No longer split between minds or places I can
      focus, when in the middle. I think that’s why I’ve always been so militant
      in the way I live my life, if I just set myself perfectly in the middle,
      my car’s wingmirrors, their angle, the left and the right, identical
      (meaning I’m perfectly in the middle), my pillow, perfectly in the middle
      of the bed (running my hands from end of pillow to end of bed until it’s
      right, having my pyjamas suit me perfectly within my socks and under my
      trousers, my sleeves pulled right the way through things. Without these
      requirements, I cannot function. With them fulfilled I can be loose, truly
      experiencing the warm gaps between harsh extremes. Every once in a while,
      I feel like my hands are on fire and that I don’t know where I go in
      amongst myself for lots of the day. I spend my time thinking that fruit
      flies are annoying or that I can’t feel my feet below the elastic of my
      sock around my shin. I’d say I think a lot but a lot of the time I think
      about the things I feel or have felt, things I’ve said or didn’t say or
      haven’t said yet, never to be remembered. I don’t know I know a lot or
      know that I am open to receiving new knowledge ever, but my senses I know
      will detect and explore and make me realise and produce intimately what I
      can’t communicate. All the while I know that I can breathe, that I can
      count to 1 and draw a box and that then I could count to 7 and let go of
      my breath or count to 11, and drop my hands down, place my fingers on 5,
      and that you could call me, that I could work them round to 1 and that
      we’d split apart 12, 2, 4, 8 and 10 and infinite opportunity would reveal
      itself all stable and strong and pre built And now the whole things turned
      out beautiful and it makes me want to cry on bad days and relish in the
      fact that I can feel that way and one time it might happen again soon and
      I’ll hopefully have a kind soul with me who I can cry with forever and
      I’ll remember how they smelled at that moment when recalling the scene in
      the future because it’s the only way I know how and I perceive my emotion
      through sense because the prospect of processing it through thought is too
      overwhelming and then I burst and it’s like all my favourite parts are
      here but this time I’ve produced the content I’ve intentionally selected
      rather than letting the stimulus Select my photographic eye for me and
      there are recipes and animations and interviews and insights and frames
      and snappy alternate sections and quiet and noise and Jude and Zoe are
      with me and looking through my old writing and my old physical artwork and
      thinking of my old thought-patterns or behaviours or memories I realised
      my life has functioned in quite defined vignettes and my way of thought
      has always been choppy and illiterate in a way when comparing to
      standards, I’m anti-standards, they don’t make me confident, they put me
      in a room and made me tell them what animal I thought a silhouette looked
      like or when I was young I’d go to my Nan & Granddads house and they had a
      huge collection of model cars and there were thousands in cases all over
      their small living room and I could spot a new one from a mile away, the
      other side of the room, and I’d go look at it and place it back perfectly
      as it was put down before and my mum didn’t know I was neurodivergent or
      thought in many interesting ways and for a time it feels as though she
      didn’t think of me at all, and in 5 years my sibling and I spoke to each
      other just 5 times and we shared a room for the last three of those years
      and we came out of the void together though we pulled through and there
      are threads and scenes remembered and dressing gowns adored and sincerity
      out of that all. I think those were some quiet years though, only the
      clock was ticking but quiet otherwise. Quite a big chapter that, maybe not
      worth thinking about for 8 years and one month in more and more round
      about ways but I think that’s what I’ve been stuck on and I still react to
      masculinity in the same bratty and entitled way and it’s reactionary and I
      need it to stop apparently <br />9th fret bar to 2nd <br />I’ll never lie

      the other side of their fine art degrees And my mum she was a teacher
      thereby exposing me to more bourgeois ideals like good ‘proper’ English

      First memory – written 20/07/21 It was my birthday; I was so happy. I
      lived in Bridgend with my mother, father and my sibling Jamie – I loved
      the house we lived in. My Dad had finished the decking which led out from
      the backdoor and into the garden. I stepped down off of it, bare foot as
      it was summer, and onto a slug. I cried and screamed and ran around. I had
      probably turned 8 that day. Story of me being head locked and dragged up a
      hill, I think I wrote it on paper somewhere, or have a scan <br />15/07/21
      – My first drink and cigarette – Both came at 16, the drink I don’t think
      even belonged to me but was perhaps given to me by Bradly Loveridge. We
      were sat in a quarry of Doverow Hill, Stonehouse after our secondary
      school prom. I think it was a Strongbow Dark Fruits and I don’t think I
      liked it very much or even finished it. Some people I didn’t know were
      there which signalled danger. The story of my first dosage of a cigarette
      is much more amusing, however. It was on my 16th birthday, when Callan
      Wilton asked me for an ashtray and I said he could use the pizza tray, a
      cardboard bottom of a supermarket refrigerated pizza. I think his
      then-girlfriend said that that was really lovely and I remember being
      confused. Anyway, then I asked if I could have a toke and I didn’t know
      how to do it so I probably awkwardly attempted to smoke but didn’t get it
      until he intervened with: “So you have to breath in *sharp intake of air*
      until you see the end light up(!) And then swallow that down into your
      lungs *huuuuuhh* and then breath out *phuuhhhhh* I think I did it
      successfully and was quite happy with the experience overall as I didn’t
      cough, so I left it there. <br />18/09/21 – Respond to CCI email – 28th

      Leon Trotsky’s definition of ‘lathe art’, on him not expecting all

      capital, all scopes must be explored. Juxtapose this doctrine with Oasis.
      Oasis made songs for the normal Brit (not about them; Blur), but their
      ethos pushed for bratty, laddy behaviour smashing up hotel rooms while
      wearing a parka. Is Blairite labour’s backing of this & Cool Britannia
      their way of keeping the masses tethered to their lathe, even while

      the confidence to do it & feel like I’m not being judged for being worse
      than everyone else About Kai and how so easily that could have been Jamie
      On feeling not so important Like I have to prove myself artistically On
      how I get so confused when people don’t listen to me when I talk to them,
      when they just walk away What else do I want to write about? How do I feel
      about the book? I thought I would have a lot more to say Recently it has
      been hard to know what is worthwhile work and what isn’t How do I feel
      generally? Again it has been hard to guage Need time to think Need to
      finish with this place and thrive Not just survive But to go on living
      Truly Elsewhere I know I’ll miss it And regret that the time is now gone
      for good But I know I’ll feel safe outside and far away from it all That
      I’ll want to make the effort to see people and socialise with all when
      away from working environments That I’ll want to go out and spend time
      around London meeting people and talking and having fun Only ever paint
      for fun and if it feels right Don’t do it because you think you should You
      can only do it badly then Find materials you can work with and keep it
      moving Find people, ethos and communities you can blossom within Say no to
      people more and say stop talking to me if they’re chatting rubbish Make
      things and write words and survive and use the things and spend time
      creating and look forward to times and explore and play and make a loud
      noise and figure out how to change it and embrace the past and keep
      freeform for the future and try to stay comfortable, always dress in a way
      that makes you comfortable and don’t let any… People walk in and say hey
      from the bottom of my tower I say hi But my body language and demeanor say
      what do you want I built a tower out of materials because I love materials
      so much and building And next I’ll build a stage and I can look down on
      people again as they stream by, this time from a lesser height And I hope
      I’m ready to socialise then and not be so stressed, I struggle so much
      when people present themselves to me to socialise because I want to do it
      and I want to do it well but I’m not very good at it I feel the weight of
      conversational expectation on my shoulders and I didn’t ever ask for it
      More or less I’m fine alone but then I love people when it goes right and
      I just want it to be right all the time and to not have a worry but that’s
      hard and that’s not life but that’s how my brain is so I’ve got to learn
      to control my brain and I can’t let things that are out of my control
      affect me so thank you to Felix and Frances but I did hate pot washing and
      you’d say I was drunk when I was high but we swam together, no one drowned
      and thank you to Mum and also to Nan I love you all each and every one of
      you (even you, reader) I want to be happy and at peace and quietly
      confident and not to feel anxious at all in my head every day I want to
      practice with Jude and make sound and make challenging art that is
      cohesive not just moments or things on a canvas I want people to
      appreciate me for me and sometimes that does mean making sure I’m
      comfortable and some people really do that and I feel so so loved and
      other times I feel like I miss social cues and things going on because I
      just want to be sat in the park on a day like this with colourful trees
      and breathing deeply and I’m really sensitive and people need to realise
      that and that I’m trying really hard not to write wankily now but that it
      is really fun to say hello reader in brackets (hello reader) and I wonder
      about my tone or how I come across through words but I’m sure it’s alright
      and I could even have something pleasant to say (yes?) or that we could
      have shared a moment together through this book. Mon cher lecteur, je vous
      aime… fin

      betwixt; a fascination arisen by a childhood spent in playground cages.

      creating abstract landscapes or riding a bike to a different park. But now
      I’ve started making this film this way and I’ve ran out of tapes and if I
      don’t make it all this way right now then I’ll never be able to make it
      like this again, it’ll just be another disjointed, segmented, without
